# 🎬 Movie Ratings & Awards Analysis with Python

This is an end-to-end data project exploring how movie ratings relate to award outcomes. I scraped and analyzed data from Rotten Tomatoes and the Oscars to discover what makes a movie critically acclaimed — and whether high ratings lead to Oscar wins.

## 📌 Objective

To analyze trends in movie ratings, genres, and award outcomes.  
🎯 **Key Focus:** How do Rotten Tomatoes scores and other factors relate to Oscar wins?

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Power BI**
- **Web Scraping** (BeautifulSoup & Requests)

---

## 🛠️ Data Collection

The data was scraped using custom Python scripts and supplemented with a Kaggle dataset.

📂 Located in: `/DataSets/Scraping Codes/`

- `rottentomatoes_best_movies.py` – Scrapes Rotten Tomatoes' Best 300 Movies of All Time
- `oscar-winners.py` – Scrapes Oscar nominees and winners
- `golden-globes.py` – Scrapes Golden Globes data *(Not used — replaced by a dataset from Kaggle)*

## 📊 Key Questions Explored

- What are the most common genres in the Rotten Tomatoes dataset?
- Who are the directors behind the highest-rated IMDb movies?
- Does movie duration affect ratings?
- Who are the most awarded actresses at the Oscars?
- Which movies are both highly rated *and* award-winning?
